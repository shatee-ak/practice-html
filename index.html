       <p1> As I sit outside under an old plane tree that I know very well, I get the sense that summer is slowly coming to a close. A feeling accompanies this realisation.<br> A sinking, uncomfortable feeling that I know all too well.
         <br> It is the same feeling that comes on Sunday evenings as another week </p1>
       <p2>This feeling has been with me in one way or another for most of my adult life. 
       <br> Now, as I sit in my favourite place under this old tree I can feel it again. 
        The days are getting shorter and colder. Soon the trees will be bare. <br>
         I canot quite put my finger on it but it feels like the sands of time are running out.<br>
          There is a hollow feeling in my chest. </p2>
